# marvin
*"A personal assistant for the old age."*

Designed to work in the terminal, marvin is made to simplify tasks and act as a hub for terminal services. Written in python it is very simplistic and more of a proof-of-concept than a final product. 

The core is built on a dictionary in python, to help with new commands and speed. It is designed to be easy and simple to change and edit.
